                <h3>What is <strong>it?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    The MBSR course is an 8-week program that teaches mindfulness and compassion. It is designed to help individuals manage stress, anxiety, and pain. The course is based on the gold standard, Jon Kabat-Zinn Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction training. The course includes practical tools, such as mindfulness meditation, body scanning, and simple yoga postures, as well as live mindfulness practices and group discussions. During the course, there is also the opportunity to attend a full day retreat.
                </p>
                <h3>Why should I do <strong>it?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Research has shown that MBSR can lead to various benefits, including reduced stress, improved emotional regulation, enhanced focus, better sleep quality, and increased overall well-being <strong>ref here</strong>. MBSR fosters a mindful approach to life, helping individuals develop a more compassionate relationship with themselves and the world around them. The course is a prerequisite for anyone wanting to start the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Teacher Training pathway.

            <p>The MBSR course consists of 10 sessions and 31 hours of in-person training. I will be adhering to the 2017 MBSR Curriculum Guide, which is based on more than one million hours of delivery for more than 24,000 participants, many of whom were referred by more than 7,000 doctors, hundreds of other healthcare professionals, and through self-referral. My goal is to uphold the fidelity and integrity of MBSR as described in the 2017 Curriculum Guide from the Mindful Network in order to support the effectiveness, scientific validity, and academic rigour of this method.</p>
